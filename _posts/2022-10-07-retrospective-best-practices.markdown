Following the discussion I had in my head with Aino Vonge Corry during her talk at LeanAgileScotlnaid in 2022, I wanted to throw on the paper the union of our best practices. (And have a look at her book on Retrospective Antipatterns!)

> Setting the stage should also be the moment where everyone has to speak, in order to "activate the right to speak". 

I do it by forcing people to say one top and one flop, and giving an exemple that they can copy, just so they can hear the sound of their voice.

> Gathering data can be something else than just writing on post-it. But gather problems, not solutions. Neither symptoms. Put them on the side. 

That's why I don't like "keep drop start", but use "top, flops, action" saying that we'll talk about actions after everybody will have given their tops/flops. If an action pops indeed I might keep it if it's important for the participant. 

> Have a root cause analysis somehow, to generate insights. Through a fish bone diagram for instance. And remember that there is full spectrum of preference between global thinkers and sequential thinkers: you might not want to put labels to all your bones. 

I try to go into causal analysis *after* the data is gathered. Moreover, it's really hard to see the difference between digging to find the objective fact, and inventing hypothetical cause-consequence relationship. I thus ask for examples in this case.

> The groan zone is a really interesting zone: needs psychological safety to disagree; and sometimes it's a zone the team have the culture to get out from this zone. But it might be another zone that your team hate. 

> Assume that you can't change the soup! Yet, there are things you can bring closer from the soup.

I use the French expression "balayer devant sa porte". Don't formulate actions starting with "they could/should" but "we could/should".

> About prime directive: can be controversial, we ourselves know that we have not done our best. The point here is to forgive. 

> Manage loud mouths, but with respect, allowing them to save the face. They might not know they are. It might be a valorised posture in their communities. 

> A facilitator should not be doing things. 

That's what I always begin with my points so that I switch to the facilitator mode asap. 

> For online retrospectives, prepare it! To compensate lack of body language, capabilities to change easily the support...

> And that's it!

Not for me :) ! I missed something about self-censorship, and trust and censorship in general. And the right to fumble their words for: some people need to speak to think, and thus that the first oral draft will be imprecise or even false. Precising that I always give 3-5 minutes at the beginning of pure silence for those who need to think before speaking to write their ideas on a paper.

- Note 1: antipatterns solve the problem in a way that is has to be refactored the after
- Note 2: you can sell retrospective to management saying the team will learn. But its a place to share and appreciate too.
